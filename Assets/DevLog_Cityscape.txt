TODO:

1) Basic Settings: Something I know how to do

- 30 min: making long cityscape images
- 20 min: making 3 different sprite images (default, smacked, totally smacked)
- 20 min: makin Game over screen
- 20 min: setting rigid body, gravity, etc. to player sprite
- 30 min: making obstacles by long cityscape images


2) Movements: Something I (probably) know how to do

- 20 min: moving cityscape Gameobject to right
- 15 min: testing the speed of cityscape GameObject movements, adjusting
- 30 min: making player sprite move by pressing arrow keys on the keyboard
- 20 min: Respawning new citysape images forever
- 30 min: Respawning sprite image to the center if it almost left the screen
- 20 min: Game Over screen 


3) Animations: Something I need to learn
- Changing sprite image if it's hit on the cityscape image
- Changing background image like GIF image
